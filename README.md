# Lascal

Lascal is a high-level, experimental, procedrul programming language. Every program begins with the main function:

    start
    // print a line
    println "hi";
    end.
    
Variables are dynamically typed:

    x = 5;

All Lascal files end in a `.lasc` extension or a `.las` extension. `.lascal` can all be used.
